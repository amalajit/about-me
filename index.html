  <p>One of my hobbies are biking. First of all it is good for you and it is fun. While you are biking you talk to your friends. If you are very skiled at biking you can do tricks. Be careful though you might get hurt so wear a helmet and knee pads. Some people do bike races and when they win the get a trophy. I sometimes bike with my freinds or to my school.</p>
<h1>my favorite character is lyra from his dark miterials</h1>
